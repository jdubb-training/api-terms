Term,Definition
OAuth (Open Authorization),OAuth is an open-standard authorization framework that allows third-party applications to access a user's data or resources without exposing the user's credentials. It is commonly used for secure authentication and authorization in API-based systems.
Access Token,An access token is a credential used by an application to access protected resources on behalf of a user. In OAuth, it represents the user's authorization to access specific resources.
Authorization Code Grant,The Authorization Code Grant is an OAuth 2.0 grant type that is commonly used for web applications. It involves a series of steps where the client obtains an authorization code and then exchanges it for an access token.
Implicit Grant,The Implicit Grant is an OAuth 2.0 grant type designed for client-side applications such as web browsers or mobile apps. It allows the client to obtain an access token directly without an intermediate authorization code.
Resource Owner,The resource owner is the user who owns and grants access to their protected resources. In OAuth, the resource owner is typically the end-user.
Client,The client is the application that requests access to protected resources on behalf of the resource owner. It can be a web application, mobile app, or other software.
Authorization Server,The authorization server is responsible for authenticating the resource owner, granting access tokens, and handling user authorization in OAuth-based interactions.
Scope,Scope is a parameter in OAuth that specifies the level of access requested by the client. It defines what actions the client can perform with the obtained access token.
Refresh Token,A refresh token is a credential used to obtain a new access token without requiring the resource owner to reauthenticate. It is used to extend the validity of an access token.
Scopes,Scopes in OAuth represent permissions or access levels that a client application requests during the authorization process. They define the extent of access the client is requesting.
Claims,Claims are pieces of information included in OAuth tokens, such as ID tokens and access tokens. They provide context about the user or authorization event.
Issuer (iss),The issuer (iss) claim in an OAuth token specifies the entity that issued the token, typically the authorization server. It helps verify the token's authenticity.
Expiration Time (exp),The expiration time (exp) claim in an OAuth token indicates when the token will expire. After this time, the token is considered invalid.
Subject (sub),The subject (sub) claim in an OAuth token identifies the user associated with the token. It is a unique identifier for the user.
Audience (aud),The audience (aud) claim in an OAuth token specifies the intended recipient or audience for the token. It indicates which client or application the token is meant for.
Scope (OAuth),Scopes in OAuth are strings that define the permissions requested by the client application. They determine what actions the client can take on the user's behalf.
read,The `read` scope may indicate read-only access to certain resources or data.
write,The `write` scope may indicate write (or modify) access to certain resources.
admin,In some systems, there might be an `admin` scope that grants administrative privileges or access to sensitive resources.
