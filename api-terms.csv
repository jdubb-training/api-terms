OAuth Authentication,Grant Types,Implicit Grant,An OAuth 2.0 grant type for client-side applications like web browsers or mobile apps, allowing direct access token acquisition without an authorization code.
OAuth Authentication,OAuth Components,Resource Owner,The user who owns and grants access to their protected resources in OAuth.
OAuth Authentication,OAuth Components,Authorization Server,Responsible for authenticating the resource owner, granting access tokens, and handling user authorization in OAuth-based interactions.
OAuth Authentication,OIDC (OpenID Connect),OpenID Connect (OIDC),An identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0 for authentication and identity verification, providing user information through ID tokens.
OAuth Authorization,Access Control,Access Token,A credential for an application to access protected resources on a user's behalf in OAuth, representing user authorization.
OAuth Authorization,Access Control,Client,The application requesting access to protected resources on behalf of the resource owner.
OAuth Authorization,Access Control,Scope,A parameter in OAuth specifying the level of access requested by the client, defining allowed actions.
OAuth Authorization,Token Management,Refresh Token,A credential for obtaining a new access token without reauthenticating the resource owner, extending access token validity.

OIDC Authentication,OIDC Scopes,OIDC Scopes,Define the level of access and permissions requested in OIDC-based authentication and authorization.
OIDC Authentication,OIDC Scopes,openid,A required OIDC scope for basic authentication and identity information, including user identification.
OIDC Authentication,OIDC Scopes,profile,An OIDC scope allowing the client to request additional user profile information from the identity provider.
OIDC Authentication,OIDC Scopes,email,An OIDC scope allowing the client to request the user's email address as part of the authentication process.
RESTful API,Basics,Application Programming Interface (API),A set of rules and protocols for software applications to communicate, defining methods and data formats for information exchange.
